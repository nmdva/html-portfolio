<h3> My colleagues would know me as an enthusiastic, detailed and result driven type of person.
     Currently, I am looking for new challenges and exploring new opportunities. <p>
     Throughout my work experience, I have always enjoyed the interacting with clients and colleagues, so I decided to take Dutch classes to improve my communication skills.
      As much as I enjoy taking the initiative to work diligently independently, I also enjoy working in a dynamic team. </h3>
